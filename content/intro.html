    Senior Software Engineer
    <br />
    Berlin, Germany
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer with <strong>8+ years</strong> of experience. Most
    of my career has been focused on <strong>front-end</strong> and WordPress
    development.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've worked as a team-lead, a consultant, a developer in agile-based product
    teams, and a solo developer. <br />
    I've been also involved in recruiting and mentoring developers.
  </p>
  <p>
    My technical workflow consists of using Git, writing well-tested
    maintainable code, and conducting code reviews. <br />
    I also have a keen eye for UX.
  </p>
  <p>
    I do my best to have a balance in every aspect of my job and personal life.
    <br />
    I'm a constant learner and I value personal development. <br />
    I enjoy working in non-hierarchical, transparent, and trust-based
    environments. <br />
    I love traveling, music, and technology.
