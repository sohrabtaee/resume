    Senior Software Engineer
    <br />
    Berlin, Germany
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer with <strong>8+ years</strong> of experience. For
    most of my career, I've been focused on the <strong>front-end</strong>, plus
    a few years of WordPress development.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've worked as a team-lead, a consultant, a developer in agile-based product
    teams, and a solo developer. <br />
    I've been also involved in interviewing and mentoring developers.
  </p>
  <p>
    My technical workflow consists of using Git, writing well-tested
    maintainable code, and conducting code reviews. <br />
    I also have a keen eye for UX.
  </p>
  <p>
    I do my best to have a balance in every aspect of my career and personal
    life.
    <br />
    I'm a constant learner and I value personal development. <br />
    I enjoy working in <strong>transparent</strong>,
    <strong>trust-based</strong>, and
    <strong>feedback-oriented</strong> environments.<br />
    I love traveling, music, and technology.
